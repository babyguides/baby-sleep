## Summary

Every baby varies. Keep trying things until you find something that works for you and your baby.

Sleep training (trying to stick to a schedule) is not really useful until around 4 months.

If a baby is fussy but not hungry or uncomfortable, she's probably overtired. 
Try to get more structured naps throughout the day. This is where trying lots of 
tips and tricks can help.
